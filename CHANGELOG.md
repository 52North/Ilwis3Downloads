# ILWIS 3.8.5

## Changes
The following features were added:

- Map Window selections: added the option to select polygons (previously only points and segments could be selected)
- Ellipsoidal Plate Carree coordinate system added
- Table Join operation: added the missing option to join a column of type Coord, making it possible to e.g. join the coordinates of a pointmap to its attribute table
- Space Time Cube: added the 3D windrose option; added XT, XY, YT lines
- Applications: added Parallax Correction of clouds for MSG images (under Image Processing), and Probability Density raster generation (frmprobabilitydensity)

## Bug fixes

- Improved compatibility on computers with Intel HD Graphics or combo-graphics hardware (potential crashes when opening a Map Window). Therefore the "Software Rendering" option in the ILWIS Preferences can be disabled for those who enabled it as a workaround.
- Restored Epipolar Stereopair functionality (both creation and viewing in the stereoscope window)
- Restored Import->ILWIS->TIFF functionality (message DATUM.DEF was not found)
- Improved stability and usability in the Import functionality for both maps and tables, and recognition of more projections (all Import methods, including ILWIS, GDAL and PostgreSQL)
- Improved stability in the Export functionality (both ILWIS and GDAL)
- Calling external commands works again (message Exit Code 1)
- Restored rectangle-based Zoom-Out functionality
- Restored No-Zoom option for raster images that maps each raster pixel to an on-screen pixel. Use the "Global Tools->Geometry->GeoReference" tool and select the georeference that corresponds to the raster image, in order to display it unprojected.
- Improved table Window summary statistics for boolean columns and for selected records
- Improved interactive slicing application
- Solved the problem whereby the Representation Editor showed a wrong color ramp in the preview
- Solved potential crashes and wrong results in the vector operations Union and Intersect
- Solved "vector<T> too long" error when opening corrupted polygon maps
- Improved per-class hatching and transparency for polygon layers
- Solved potential crashes when opening "Use As" data
- Color Composite: the application now creates 24 bits files when this option is selected (previously it was always 8 bits)
- MapGlue: gluing large images is now possible
- Open Street Map: corrected the zoom level making the labels readable, and solved potential deadlocks and crashes. Known issue: OSM may not show in 3D-view, depending on the viewing angle.
- DEM Hydro-Processing functions: solved potential "vector <T> too long" and "Find Error" problems, and the menu is now arranged in the recommended workflow order.
- Maplist Statistics: solved the "Encountered an improper argument" error so it works again
- Solved inconsistent behavior in iff statement when one of the parameters is undef (?): iff (a,b,?) is now the same as iff (not a,?,b)
- Solved crashes or empty results in copying a map to the clipboard when using WMS and Open Street Map, or when using Software Rendering
- Solved crashes and inconsistent behavior in the Cross Section, Hovmoeller and Track Profile tools
- Solved many random crashes in ILWIS

# ILWIS 3.8

ILWIS 3.8 represents a major upgrade from ILWIS 3.7. Changes and improvements have mainly focussed on visualization, however, additional issues have been addressed.

## Changes

Visualization

- General
  - Display options form has been replaced by an extended and improved Layer tree on the left side of the map window.
  - Pixel info has a permanent location on the lower left side of the map window.
  - The map window has a command line which works the same as the main windowâ€™s command line. Maps calculated in this command line are automatically added to the map window.
  - Map window menus have been substantially reduced. Much of their functionality has been moved to the Layer tree.
  - LatLon maps can show their coordinates as decimal coordinates. This toggle can be found in the Options/Metric Coordinates menu.
  - Visualizations can be shown full screen without any UI elements. This toggle can be found in the Options/Full Screen menu.
  - Automatic reprojection and resampling is available. The map window can display maps of different geometries (both raster and vector) and will automatically morph the maps to a target geometry. The geometry of the map can be changed on-the-fly.
  - Annotation is available in the map window for legends (per layer), boundaries and scale bar.
  - The tree node "Display Tools" has a context menu that controls the visibility of tools.
  - Base maps have been added to the system folder. This (small) set of maps can be used as background/context layers. Each base map acts as a system object.
  - Map backgrounds and surroundings can be changed with respect to color and transparency.
  - The distance measurer can be used on paths (multiple line segments) with the help of the the ctrl button.

- Layer tree
  - The previous layer tree has been massively extended. It now replaces part of the main menu. "Tools" that control a coherent subset of visualization properties are available at all levels of the tree. They can be global or have effect on only one layer.

- 2D maps
  - Raster maps
    - Enhanced performance
    - Interactive representation value creation
  - Polygon maps
    - Enhanced performace. The first time a polygon map is shown it generates a support file (triangulation) which it uses subsequently.
    - Boundaries and Areas are separate entities with separate properties.
  - Segment maps
    -  Enhanced performance. All vector maps now use a spatial indexing scheme to quickly retrieve the relation between a coordinate and its features. This speeds up the retrieval of segment values at a particular location.
  - Point maps
    - Symbolization has been completely changed. There is now one consistent system that uses small "svg-like" text files to define the symbolization.
  - Object collections
    - An object collection of maps of the same type and domain can function as a single layer. As a result, all maps are stretched in the same way.
  - Map lists
    - Dedicated tools for map lists. Apart from animations, a set of dedicated tools has been implemented specifically for map lists.
    - Cross section. A graph can be displayed for a point location. It shows all the values of the map list for that point. Multiple points can be defined with the help of the ctrl button.
    - Hovmoeller diagram. A pattern detection representation of lines drawn on a map can be combined with a map list to produce a Hovmoeller diagram.
- Tools
  - Track profile. This displays a profile graph of a path on the map. A multi-segment path can be created with the help of the ctrl button. Multiple maps can be added to the profile graph to demonstrate relationships between the profiles of these maps.
  - Transparency. This can be added at many levels and mostly on-the-fly. Transparency follows a 0 (no transparency) to 100 (fully transparent) scale. It can be applied to the following objects/properties:
    - Layers: raster, polygon, segment, point
    - Areas and/or boundaries of polygons
    - Lines of grid
    - Extrusions (3D)
    - partial transparent interactive representation ???
    - Selections of polygon maps based on class
    - Selections of raster maps based on numerical value
  - Interactive value stretching. Dymamically adapts stretch values based on a set of sliders (min,max).
  - Attribute tool. The display attribute (column) can be changed on the fly.
  - Layer applications. All applications relevant for a certain layer type can be started from the Layer tree. Any maps produced here are immediately added to the map window.
  - Point editor and segment editor. These tools have been rewritten and are now part of the Layer tree.

- 3D Maps
  - All layers can be shown in 3D via a simple toggle.
  - Z coordinates can be any numerical value source; e.g. raster maps, attribute columns.
  - Rotation can be carried out by pressing the ctrl button and the left mouse button simultaneously, zooming via ctrl button and the mouse wheel, and panning with the ctrl button and the right mouse button.
  - All 3D properties are controlled by the 3D properties tool which is activated by the context menu of the display options node.
  - 3D grid creation is possible.
  - Tools
    - 3D properties. Controls Z-data source, scaling and offsets and the use of extrusions (and properties).

- Animations (formerly slide show)
  - Animations can be made from map lists (raster) or object collections (vector).
  - Animations function as a normal layer in the map window. Tools applicable for single layers, work for animations.
  - Animations work in 3D
  - Multiple Animations can run in one or more map windows (however, there may be performance issues).
  - Animations may use index information or real time information. Real time information is derived from a time column in a map list's attribute table.
  - Several animations may be synschronized according to index information or real time.
  - Animations can be saved as .avi files.
  - Tools
    - Highlight tool. Singles out a selection on the map to highlight during animation
    - Threshold tool. Changes display colors of pixels above and/or below a certain threshold based on an attribute table. This tool can be accessed from the animation management form.


## New applications

  - MapListCondense: Condenses a map list into a smaller map list, i.e. aggregates maps into one map according to a step size and specific aggregation rules.
  - MapListExpand: Expands the map list and creates intermediate maps based on certain interpolation rules, i.e. the reverse of MapListCondense.
  - MapListChangeDetection: Makes use of a number of simple change detection schemes to determine changes in map lists.
  - MapAggregateMaplist: Aggregates a map list in a single map based on certain aggregation rules.
  - TableAttributeFromMapList: Creates an attribute table for a map list based on aggregated numbers from maps in a map list
  - ColumnAttributeFromMapList: Creates an attribute column for a map list based on aggregated numbers from maps in an existing map list table
  - TableCreateTimeColumn: Creates a time column in a table. The time column is derived from a map list based on a (user-defined) pattern in the name of the map list.


## General

  - Map list and Object collection can have an attribute table. Each record matches the corresponding index in the list/collection.
  - The Operation list has been extended to include a "finder" which filters the list.
  - A Spanish UI translation has been included.
  - The help system has been decompiled and now uses html files instead of the bundled (chm) format.
  - The domain "time" has been included. This handles date/time information based on an ISO standard.
  - ILWIS now has a server component that can run as an (ILWIS-specific) application server. A WPS server has been implemented.
